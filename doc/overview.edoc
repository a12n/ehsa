Erlang HTTP server authentication modules. Standard basic and digest
authentication schemes are implemented. Integrity protection is
supported for the digest scheme. The modules are mainly useful with
REST-based systems which do not provide any means of authenticating
requests (Cowboy REST handlers, Webmachine).
